    "1\\. After a few beers your CIO invited his buddy from Blue Moon consulting to propose a project using data mining to improve the targeting of the new service that you have been a principal in developing. The service has been quite successful so far, being marketed over the last 6 months via your ingenious, and very inexpensive, word-of-mouth campaign. You've already garnered a pretty large customer base without any targeting, and you've been seeing this success as your best stepping stone to bigger and better things in the firm. \n",
    "\n",
    "After some reflection, you've decided that your best course of action is to play a key role in ensuring the success of this data mining project as well. You agree with your CIO's statement in a meeting with Blue Moon, that accurate targeting might cost-effectively expand your audience substantially to consumers that word-of-mouth would not reach. You accept that what Blue Moon says about the characteristics of your service is accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on what we have covered in class and in the book, identify the four most serious weaknesses/flaws in this abridged version of Blue Moon's proposal, and suggest how to ameliorate them.  Your answer should be 4 bullet points, each comprising 2-4 sentences: 1-2 sentences stating each weakness, and 1-2 sentences suggesting a better alternative.  Maximal credit will be given when the 4 points are as independent as possible.\n",

This can be handled if the predictive model is built on a more generalized dataset containing all companys' current customers.\n",
    "* Second, relying on interpretation of coefficients to infer how significant attributes are is not the best approach. The use of regularization can offer a better aftermath for maybe not being the current new customers' dataset as huge as necessary to control variance and having high dimensionality among its feature since the word of mouth tend to cluster users with similar profiles.\n",
    "* Third, assuming that LR is the best choice per se can be a mistake for not camparing its performance against other models' performance. In order to maximize the targeted campaign's effectiveness, it is worth a comparison among different models' performance scores as a means to find out which one is the best for using.\n",
    "* Finally, applying the targeted offer to new consumers based on a dataset of subscribers garnered through word of mouth can be a mistake, because the profile of current new customers influenced by word of mouth can not be responsive to the intended targeted offer. This can be addressed through insertion of new attributes beyond demographics and usage to both considered datasets aiming to diminish the uncertainty with regards to the effectiveness of the targeted offer.\n",

From your reading you know that the naive Bayes classifier works by calculating the conditional probabilities of each feature, $e_i$, occuring with each class $c$ and treating them independently.

The Laplace smoothing allow setting probability higher than zero when a word does not appear on the training dataset.
